# Agent Boot — SUDS v2

## Ground truth
- `agentrc.yaml` — system configuration
- `.agentrc/bootstrap.md` — current iteration state
- `.agentrc/tasks/` — task state (read-only cache, Volon is source of truth)

## Core rules
- Always check Volon for your assigned tasks: use `volon_tasks_list` with project_id="suds-v2"
- Update task status via `volon_task_transition` when starting (doing), completing (done), or blocked
- Do NOT proceed to next task until current task is transitioned
- Ground truth is in files and Volon, not chat history
